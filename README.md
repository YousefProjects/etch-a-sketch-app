# etch-a-sketch-app

This is my participation in Mintbean Hackathon. It was good exercise for Js events, and canvas api.

I can't take credit from making this project, to make a drawing app I followed Brad Traversy's tutorial in his course '50 Projects In 50 Days - HTML, CSS & JavaScript'.

I made three main adjustments in Traversy's code:
    1. I changed the UI design to suit my project concept.
    2. I added Js eventlistener to draw with arrows buttons.
    3. I added Js eventlistener to draw with keyboard keys.
